### Hero Section
**Badge:** Digital transformation for SMEs

**Headline:** Your Business. Digitised Properly. Finally.

**Subheadline:** You've built a great business. Now it deserves its own operating system.

**Body:** We act as your internal CTO and delivery team - designing and building the systems your business has always needed.

**Value Props:** Clarity + Speed + Capability

**CTA Buttons:**
- Book a Working Session
- See What We Build

### Problem Section
**Badge:** The truth nobody tells SMEs

**Headline:** Spreadsheets feel comfortable until they become a trap.

**Problem Cards:**
- Manual updates everywhere
- Copy-paste between systems
- No real visibility
- Decisions made on gut feel

**Body Copy:**
Most SMEs run on spreadsheets, inboxes and heroic memory. You've built something real - but your systems haven't kept up.

Your team is firefighting because the systems you need don't exist. You're compensating with spreadsheets, memory and heroic effort.

And here's the truth: none of this is your fault.

SMEs were never given access to the tools, capability or expertise that bigger firms take for granted. Digital transformation was sold as something slow, expensive and out of reach.

**Tagline:** We're here to change that.

**Bottom Badge:** Our superpower isn't AI. It's making digital transformation accessible.

---

### Solution Section
**Headline:** Your Business Operating System

**Subheadline:** One simple system, built around how your business actually runs.

**What we don't build:**
- Not software you have to bend yourself to fit
- Not a one-size-fits-all CRM
- Not a template
- Not a patchwork of tools held together with hope

**What we deliver:**
- A single place for jobs, customers, data and workflow
- Dashboards that show real margins, not guesses
- Automations that remove repetitive admin
- AI used practically, safely and only where it helps
- Systems shaped around your people and process
- All delivered in days, not months

**Feature Pillars:**
- **Speed** - days, not months
- **Visibility** - real-time data
- **Practical AI** - useful automation, not gimmicks
- **Human-first** - built around your team

---

### Process Section
**Headline:** How it works

**Subheadline:** Three simple steps to transform your operations

**Step 1 - Discovery Day**
- Clarity first
- We learn how your business really runs, identify the blockers and show you what can change. You leave with clarity, a value picture and a working starting point.
- Walk away with insights

**Step 2 - Build Week**
- Working product in your hands
- We build the first usable version of your business operating system. Not mockups. Not decks. Real software you can use immediately.
- Real, working software

**Step 3 - Evolve**
- Add capability at your pace
- You add capability at your own pace using Credits. No retainers. No long contracts. No surprises. Just practical improvements when you want them.
- Scale on your terms

**Bottom Banner:** AI plus humans equals practical transformation. Digital capability used to be slow and expensive - it's not anymore.

## ABOUT PAGE

### Hero Section
**Headline:** Built for SMEs who deserve better

**Subheadline:** 30 years of building systems. One mission: Give SMEs the digital capability bigger firms take for granted.

---

### Why This Exists Section
**Headline:** Why this exists

The way SMEs build digital capability is broken. And I got tired of watching it happen.

I've spent 30 years building products, fixing operations and delivering real systems across aviation, finance, healthcare and digital operations. I've seen what works. I've seen what fails. And the pattern is always the same.

**Callout:** Most transformation failures are not technical. They are human.

I've watched businesses spend six months debating a deck instead of fixing the problem. I've watched consultancies sell frameworks that gather dust. I've watched agencies deliver beautiful websites that do nothing to help people do their jobs. I've watched dev teams over-engineer systems nobody asked for.

And meanwhile, SMEs are running multi-million pound operations on **spreadsheets, inboxes and heroic memory.**

Not because they lack ambition. Because they lack access.

No internal tech team. No CTO. No one who can diagnose the real problem and actually deliver a fix. No time to step back and see clearly. No partner who tells them the truth. No access to the kind of capability that bigger firms take for granted.

**That gap is why this company exists.**

I built something different because SMEs deserve better. They move fast. They make decisions. They don't hide behind committees. They just need someone who can match that pace and build what they actually need.

My approach is simple: get in the room, understand the real problem, and build a working solution before anyone has time to write a specification document.

Working prototypes on day one. MVPs in a week. Systems tailored to your operation. No jargon. No theatre. No wasted effort.

**Callout:** If you can describe the problem, we can build the system.

---

### Who We Are Section
**Headline:** Who we are

We are senior product, technology and operations people who have spent decades building and scaling complex systems.

**Callout:** We act as the SME equivalent of an internal CTO plus a high-performing delivery team.

We design and build the digital operating system your business should have had years ago. Fast. Tailored. Practical. Affordable.

**Callout:** Clarity + Speed + Capability.

**Our combined expertise covers:**
- Product strategy and rapid build
- Cloud architecture and modern engineering
- AI-assisted development and automation
- Operations and workflow optimisation
- Data modelling and intelligent dashboards
- Change, adoption and continuous improvement

We do not impose frameworks. We do not sell boilerplate processes. We do not gold-plate technology.

**We amplify what already works inside your business and remove what slows you down.**

---

### How We Work Section
**Headline:** How we work

1. **Clarity before complexity**
   - We cut through noise. We find what is really blocking you. Fast.

2. **Build the smallest thing that creates real value**
   - No bloat. No scope creep. Just the tool that moves the needle.

3. **Show working prototypes on day one**
   - We do not talk for weeks. We build. You see your system with your own data before spending anything meaningful.

4. **Use AI safely and predictably**
   - We use AI to move fast and keep costs down. But every system is shaped by experienced humans who understand your business - not just the technology.

5. **Leave clients with capability that lasts**
   - Every engagement leaves you with permanent improvement. Real tools. Real assets. Not documentation. Not theory.

6. **Make transformation accessible, not intimidating**
   - Our superpower isn't AI. It's making digital transformation accessible to businesses like yours.

---

### What We Believe Section
**Headline:** What we believe

SMEs do not lack ambition. They lack access.

They have no CTO, no delivery team, no one who can translate their business into the systems they actually need.

**That's the gap we fill.**

**Callout:** AI + Humans = Practical transformation.

We give SMEs their own operating system so they can run their business with clarity, confidence and ease.

---

### Final Statement Section
**Headline:** If your business is held together by good people compensating for bad systems, we fix that.

It is time SMEs had their own operating system.

That is what we build.

**CTA:** Book a Working Session

We design and deliver the software your business actually needs. Not what a vendor wants to sell you. Not a template you have to work around.

**Icon:** Automate

**Headline:** Automate
**Subheadline:** Remove manual work forever

If your team is copy-pasting between systems, repeating the same steps daily, or chasing information that should just be there - we treat that as a design fault.

We fix it by connecting your tools, streamlining your process, and adding smart automation where it actually matters.

**What we automate:**
- Invoicing and billing
- Reporting and dashboards
- Scheduling and reminders
- Workflow triggers and handoffs
- Data processing and validation
- Customer communications

**Callout:** Automation isn't about replacing people. It's about freeing them to do useful work.

---

**Icon:** Amplify

**Headline:** Amplify
**Subheadline:** Visibility, intelligence and insight

Once your operation flows through one place, you finally see it clearly.

Margins. Workload. Risk. Opportunity. Bottlenecks. All in plain English - not buried in spreadsheets or someone's head.

We add dashboards, AI-driven summaries and real-time insight that help you make better decisions faster, with less noise.

**What we amplify:**
- Profit and margin visibility
- Bottleneck and blocker detection
