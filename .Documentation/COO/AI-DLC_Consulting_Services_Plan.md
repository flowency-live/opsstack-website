# AI-DLC: AI Consulting Services
## Full Service Offering Plan & Copy

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** February 2025
**Location:** Flowency website (`/ai-services`)
**Brands:** Flowency (primary) + OpsStack (delivery capability)

---

## Executive Summary

AI-DLC (AI Delivery Life Cycle) is a unified AI consulting offering that spans:
- **Boardroom to dev team** (strategic to tactical)
- **Enterprise to one-man-band** (any organisation size)
- **Advisory to hands-on delivery** (talk to build)

**Positioning:** "AI for impact, not for hype"

**Differentiation:** We don't just advise on AI strategy or build AI tools. We do both - and connect them. Most AI consultancies are either strategic (slides, no delivery) or tactical (build, no governance). AI-DLC is the rare consultancy that spans the full stack.

**Primary CTA:** Discovery Session booking (Cal.com integration)

## The Market Problem

### The Crowded AI Consulting Landscape

| Type | What they do | What they miss |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| **Big consultancies** (Accenture, McKinsey, Deloitte) | Strategy decks, transformation programmes | Actual delivery, SME accessibility |
| **Dev agencies "doing AI"** | Build chatbots and integrations | Strategic alignment, governance |
| **AI tool vendors** | Push their platform | Your outcome, your context |
| **Solo prompt engineers** | Tactical prompt work | Enterprise thinking, scalability |
| **AI startups** | Cool demos | Production readiness, your business context |

### The Three AI Failure Modes

**1. AI Paralysis**
- "We know we should be doing something with AI, but where do we start?"
- Too many options, unclear ROI, fear of getting it wrong
- Affects: SMEs, traditional businesses, risk-averse leadership

**2. AI Theatre**
- "We've done lots of demos and POCs, but nothing's in production"
- Innovation theatre without operational impact
- Affects: Large organisations, IT departments, innovation teams

**3. AI Chaos**
- "We're shipping AI features fast, but things are getting messy"
- Speed without alignment, cognitive debt accumulating
- Affects: Fast-moving tech companies, product teams, startups

---

## The AI-DLC Framework

### The Core Insight

> "If your clarity is off by 5%, AI will amplify it by 500%."

AI doesn't just accelerate delivery - it accelerates whatever you point it at. Point it at unclear intent, and you get expensive confusion. Point it at aligned strategy, and you get compounding value.

**AI-DLC is how you ensure you're pointing AI at the right things.**

### The Four Pillars

│     Prototypes, products, automations, integrations          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤

│     Observability, drift detection, learning loops           │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## Target Markets & Messaging

### Market Segment 1: Enterprise Leaders

**Who they are:**
- C-suite, board members, strategy teams
- £50m+ turnover organisations
- Regulated industries, complex stakeholder environments

**Their pain:**
- "We have 15 AI initiatives and no idea which ones matter"
- "The board wants an AI strategy but we don't know what that means"
- "We're spending on AI but can't prove ROI"

**What they need:**
- Alignment clarity before more spend
- Governance framework that doesn't slow things down
- Connection between AI investment and business outcomes

**Messaging for them:**

> **Headline:** Forget your AI strategy. Where's your intent alignment strategy?
>
> **Body:** The question isn't "how do we use AI?" The question is "what are we trying to achieve, and will AI get us there faster?" Most AI strategies are technology shopping lists. Yours should be an economic roadmap.
>
> **CTA:** Book an Executive AI Alignment Session

---

### Market Segment 2: Product & Engineering Teams

**Who they are:**
- CTOs, VP Engineering, Product Managers, Tech Leads
- Teams already building with AI (Copilot, LLMs, automation)
- Under pressure to ship AI features

**Their pain:**
- "We're shipping fast but accumulating tech debt we can't see"
- "Every team is experimenting differently, no patterns"
- "We built it, but we can't explain why it does what it does"

**What they need:**
- AI-native development patterns
- Prompt engineering that scales
- Observability and governance without bureaucracy

**Messaging for them:**

> **Headline:** From spec to production. No slideshows.
>
> **Body:** Don't like it? Rip it up and start again. In minutes. Software becomes disposable like infrastructure did with IaC. Write the spec. Generate. Deploy. Iterate. Your differentiators become your data, your clarity of intent, and your ability to steer.
>
> **CTA:** Talk to us about AI-native delivery

---

### Market Segment 3: Operations & Process Teams

**Who they are:**
- COOs, Operations Directors, Process Improvement teams
- Running back-office, customer service, finance operations
- Seeing AI automation demos but unsure how to adopt

**Their pain:**
- "We're automating broken processes, not fixing them"
- "The RPA project failed, why would AI be different?"
- "We need to reduce headcount costs but can't compromise quality"

**What they need:**
- Process redesign before automation
- AI that augments humans, not just replaces tasks
- Quick wins that prove value before big investment

**Messaging for them:**

> **Headline:** AI-native process transformation. Not faster automation of broken processes.
>
> **Body:** The problem with most automation is it encodes your current chaos. AI gives you the chance to redesign how work actually flows - then automate the improved version. We help you see where value leaks, then build AI that plugs the gaps.
>
> **CTA:** Request a Process Flow Assessment

---

### Market Segment 4: SME Owners & Founders

**Who they are:**
- Business owners, £500k-£20m turnover
- Running on spreadsheets, email, and good intentions
- Hearing about AI but feeling locked out

**Their pain:**
- "AI feels like an enterprise thing, not for businesses our size"
- "I don't have a tech team to implement this"
- "I need practical help, not consultancy waffle"

**What they need:**
- Practical AI that solves real problems
- Someone who speaks business, not tech jargon
- Affordable entry point, clear ROI

**Messaging for them:**

> **Headline:** AI capability for businesses that don't have AI teams.
>
> **Body:** You don't need a data science department to use AI. You need someone who understands your operation and can encode your best thinking into tools that work. We help SMEs get the AI advantage that bigger firms take for granted - at a fraction of the cost.
>
> **CTA:** Book a Free Working Session

AI for impact,
not for hype.

[Subhead]
From boardroom strategy to production code.

```

---

### Section 2: The Problem

**Layout:** Three cards, each representing a failure mode

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
The three ways AI adoption fails

[Card 1 - AI Paralysis]
"We know we should do something, but where do we start?"

Too many options. Unclear ROI. Fear of getting it wrong.
You're not alone - most organisations are stuck here.

[Card 2 - AI Theatre]
"Lots of demos, nothing in production."

Innovation theatre without operational impact.
The POCs pile up. The business value doesn't.

[Card 3 - AI Chaos]
"We're shipping fast, but things are getting messy."

Speed without alignment. Cognitive debt accumulating.
What happens when the AI does something you can't explain?
```

---

### Section 3: Our Approach (The Four Pillars)

**Layout:** Four horizontal or stacked cards with icons

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
The AI-DLC Framework

[Intro]
If your clarity is off by 5%, AI will amplify it by 500%.
AI-DLC ensures you're pointing AI at the right things.

[Pillar 1 - ALIGN]
Icon: Target/Compass
Where are we going? Why?

Strategic clarity before AI spend. Intent alignment. Economic prioritisation. The "why" that guides everything else.

[Pillar 2 - ENCODE]
Icon: Brain/Lightbulb
What do we know?

Capture your best people's best thinking. Turn expertise into AI agents. Encode decisions, not just data.

[Pillar 3 - BUILD]
Icon: Rocket/Hammer
What do we ship?

Prototypes in days, not months. AI-native development. From spec to production without the slideshow.

[Pillar 4 - GOVERN]
Icon: Shield/Eye
How do we sustain?

Observability. Drift detection. Value tracking. The feedback loop that keeps AI aligned as it scales.
```

---

### Section 4: Who We Help

**Layout:** Tabbed or accordion interface, four segments

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
We work with everyone who needs AI to work.

[Tab 1 - Enterprise Leaders]
Headline: Forget your AI strategy. Where's your intent alignment strategy?

For C-suite and boards who need to connect AI investment to business outcomes. Not another technology shopping list - an economic roadmap.

What you get:
• AI Investment Roadmap
• Initiative prioritisation
• Governance framework
• Board-ready narrative

[Tab 2 - Product & Engineering]
Headline: From spec to production. No slideshows.

For CTOs and product teams who are building with AI but need patterns that scale. AI-native development without the cognitive debt.

What you get:
• AI-native architecture patterns
• Production prompt systems
• Observability and governance
• Hands-on delivery support

[Tab 3 - Operations Teams]
Headline: AI-native process transformation.

For COOs and operations leaders who need automation that actually works. Redesign the process first, then automate the improved version.

What you get:
• Process flow assessment
• Value leak identification
• AI automation design
• Implementation and training

[Tab 4 - SME Owners]
Headline: AI capability for businesses without AI teams.

For business owners who want the AI advantage that bigger firms take for granted. Practical, affordable, no jargon.

What you get:
• Working prototype on day one
• Your expertise, encoded
• Tools shaped to your operation
• Ongoing evolution as you grow
```

---

### Section 5: How We Engage

**Layout:** Stepped process flow (vertical or horizontal)

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
Start with a conversation. See where it goes.

[Step 1 - Discovery]
Free · 60 minutes

A conversation, not a pitch. We understand your situation, you understand our approach. Walk away with clarity either way.

[CTA] Book a Discovery Session

[Step 2 - Assessment]
Half-day to 2 days

Deep dive into your AI readiness, process flows, or cognitive debt. Actionable recommendations, not theoretical frameworks.

[Step 3 - Sprint]
2 weeks

Focused delivery. Prove value with a prototype, POC, or quick win before committing to bigger investment.

[Step 4 - Build]
4-8 weeks

Full feature delivery. Production-ready, deployed, documented, supported.

[Step 5 - Retain]
Ongoing

Continuous capability. Your AI evolves with your business. Advisory, delivery, and support.
```

---

### Section 6: The Cognitive Debt Warning

**Layout:** Full-width callout/banner

**Copy:**

```
[Headline]
Cognitive debt is the new technical debt.

[Body]
Code that works but nobody can explain why. Automations running critical systems with zero docs. AI models making decisions we can't trace. Critical business logic buried in tools nobody owns.

The $2 trillion in global tech debt isn't a backlog of code - it's a backlog of bad decisions. AI will accelerate both outcomes and debt.

You choose which.

[CTA]
Request a Cognitive Debt Audit
```

---

### Section 7: Industries (Light Touch)

**Layout:** Logo cloud or simple text list

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
Because we encode YOUR logic, any knowledge work benefits.

[Industries Listed]
• Consulting & Professional Services
• Financial Services & Fintech
• Legal & Compliance
• Healthcare & Pharma
• Creative & Communications
• Private Equity & Investments
• HR & People Operations
• Automotive & Manufacturing

[Footnote]
Don't see your industry? If your business runs on expertise and decisions, AI-DLC applies. Get in touch.
```

---

### Section 8: Why Us

**Layout:** Comparison or differentiator cards

**Copy:**

```
[Section Header]
Not another AI consultancy.

[Differentiator 1]
Strategy AND delivery
Most firms do one or the other. We do both - and connect them. Your AI strategy doesn't live in a deck. It lives in production.

[Differentiator 2]
Enterprise AND SME
We work with multinationals on governance frameworks and SMEs on practical AI tools. Same principles, scaled to your context.

[Differentiator 3]
Your logic, not ours
We don't push platforms or frameworks. We encode YOUR expertise, YOUR processes, YOUR way of working.

[Differentiator 4]
Delivery speed
Working prototypes in days. Production features in weeks. No 6-month implementation programmes.
```

---

### Section 9: CTA Section

**Layout:** Full-width, bold colour background

**Copy:**

```
[Headline]
Ready to make AI work for you?

[Body]
Start with a 60-minute Discovery Session. Free. No pitch. Just a conversation about where you are and where AI could take you.

[CTA Button]
Book Your Discovery Session

## Brand Voice Guidelines

### Tone
- **Direct:** No waffle, no jargon, say what you mean
- **Confident:** We've done this, we know it works
- **Practical:** Outcomes over theory, delivery over decks
- **Accessible:** Enterprise thinking without enterprise pomposity

### Language Principles

**DO:**
- Use active voice ("We build" not "Solutions are built")
- Lead with outcomes ("Get clarity" not "Gain strategic alignment")
- Acknowledge pain directly ("Most AI projects fail" not "AI adoption presents challenges")
- Use "you/your" (client-centric framing)

**DON'T:**
- Use buzzwords without definition (if you say "agentic", explain it)
- Promise without evidence (claims need proof)
- Sound like a big consultancy (no "leveraging synergies")
- Use "cutting-edge", "revolutionary", "state-of-the-art" (show, don't tell)

### Key Phrases (Approved)

From Flowency:
- "Cognitive debt is the new technical debt"
- "If your clarity is off by 5%, AI will amplify it by 500%"
- "Execution isn't the constraint anymore. Alignment is."
- "IntentOps spans both frontiers"

From OpsStack:
- "Working prototype on day one"
- "Everything you need. Nothing you don't."
- "Your problem. Our system. No templates."
- "Days, not months."

From ValueStack (borrowed lightly):
- "AI for impact, not for hype"
- "Encode your expertise"
- "Your best people on their best day"
- "Engage. Encode. Scale." (consider adapting to "Align. Encode. Build. Govern.")
