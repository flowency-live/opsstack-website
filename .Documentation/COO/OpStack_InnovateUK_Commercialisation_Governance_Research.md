## Headlines (what matters)
- **Innovate UK explicitly requires an exploitation plan** using their template, and it is **reviewed at set-up and then at every progress review** by the project’s monitoring support (MSP / monitoring officer process).  
  Evidence: UKRI Innovate UK guidance on post-award requirements states the exploitation plan is created using the latest template and is reviewed ongoing at project progress review meetings.

- **UKRI (research councils) commonly uses “Researchfish”** to collect outcomes/impact; Innovate UK has a different reporting route, but the existence of Researchfish shows there is an established market for **structured outcome reporting**.  
  Evidence: UKRI “Reporting your project’s outcomes” describes Researchfish and notes Innovate UK is different; UKRI renewed contract with Researchfish (Elsevier) in 2025.

  https://www.ukri.org/news/update-on-research-outcomes-collection-service/

- There is a **large commercial ecosystem of “Grant Management Systems” (GMS)**, but most are designed for **funders/administering bodies**, not grant recipients trying to operationalise a commercialisation plan.  
  Evidence examples: SmartyGrants (UK), Flexigrant, Capita digital grant management, Unit4 grant management, AIMS grant management software.

  https://www.grantmanagementsoftware.com/

- There *are* products for **post-award tracking** (milestones, deliverables, budgets), but they skew **US / institutional** and are often finance/compliance heavy rather than “SOM capture” and exploitation evidence.  
  Evidence examples: InfoEd post-award grants management; Key Solutions post-award grants management; Instrumentl’s post-award tooling overview (US-centric).

  https://www.instrumentl.com/blog/post-award-grant-management-software

- Separate to grant tooling, there is a mature category of **Benefits Realisation / Strategic Portfolio Management** platforms that track outcomes/value across initiatives. This overlaps strongly with the “prove exploitation/SOM” need, even if not grant-specific.  
  Evidence example: Wovex positions itself as benefits realisation management software for tracking outcomes; Planisware/Planview/ServiceNow etc. position around portfolio governance and alignment.

## 1) What Innovate UK is actually asking for (ground truth)
### 1.1 Exploitation plan is a formal artefact and reviewed repeatedly
UKRI/Innovate UK guidance states:
- exploitation plan should be a **separate document**
- created using Innovate UK’s **latest exploitation plan template**
- reviewed at set up and **ongoing at each project progress review meeting**

Source:  
https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/general-guidance/what-happens-if-you-receive-a-funding-offer/

### 1.2 Innovate UK provides an exploitation plan template (example publication)
UKRI has published exploitation plan templates (example: ATI programme).  
Source (includes exploitation plan template file):  
https://www.ukri.org/publications/ati-programme-strategic-batches-supporting-documents/

(You may also see the template as a direct ODT download in GOV.UK publishing, depending on competition context.)

---

## 2) What products exist today (evidence-based landscape)

### Category A — Funder-side Grant Management Systems (GMS)
These systems typically cover: applications/intake → assessment → approvals → payments → reporting / impact dashboards.

Examples (evidence):
- **SmartyGrants** (UK): positions as end-to-end grant lifecycle software including reporting and impact measurement.  
  https://www.smartygrants.co.uk/help-sheets/5-things-uk-funders-should-look-for-in-grant-management-software-and-how-smartygrants-delivers
- **Flexigrant**: describes dashboards, budget tracking, grant programme visibility.  
  https://flexigrant.com/grant-management-system
- **Capita – Digital grant management**: highlights audit/impact assessment and outcome tracking for grant schemes.  
  https://www.capita.com/services/grant-disbursement/digital-grant-management
- **Unit4 – Grant management**: describes grant lifecycle features incl. transparency, tracking actuals/forecast/budget and workflows.  
  https://www.unit4.com/industries/nonprofit-erp-accounting-software/grant-management
- **AIMS Grant Management Software**: positions from application to impact reporting.  
  https://www.grantmanagementsoftware.com/
- UK Government digital marketplace listing referencing “Grant and Grants Management” service (G-Cloud).  
  https://www.applytosupply.digitalmarketplace.service.gov.uk/g-cloud/services/816216360619895

**Relevance to OpStack**
- These tools target **grant administrators/funders**, not necessarily SMEs running a commercialisation plan.
- They show the market is real, but OpStack’s opportunity is likely **recipient-side exploitation execution** (see “Gaps” section).

---

### Category B — Outcomes & impact reporting platforms used by UK funders (research context)
- **Researchfish** is explicitly used by UKRI research councils for outcomes reporting; UKRI renewed its contract with Researchfish (Elsevier) in 2025.  
  Evidence:  
  https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/reporting-your-projects-outcomes/  
  https://www.ukri.org/news/update-on-research-outcomes-collection-service/

**Relevance to OpStack**
- Researchfish is an existence proof that funders value **structured, comparable outcome data**.
- Innovate UK is stated as “different” in reporting route on UKRI’s page, so OpStack should not assume it can “replace Researchfish”; rather it can complement Innovate UK’s exploitation governance.

---

### Category C — Post-award / compliance tracking tools (recipient & institutional operations)
These systems emphasise:
- milestone/deliverable tracking
- budgets, cost allocation, audits
- terms and conditions

Examples:
- **InfoEd – Post-Award Grants Management**: explicitly mentions tracking deliverables, milestones, budgets and terms/conditions.  
  https://www.infoedglobal.com/products/post-award-grants-management/
- **Key Solutions – Post-award grants management**: focuses on managing budgets, deliverables, sub-awards, syncing with financial systems.  
  https://www.keyusa.com/post-award-grants-management-software
- A broader (US-leaning) view of “post-award grant management tools” including Instrumentl etc.  
  https://www.instrumentl.com/blog/post-award-grant-management-software

**Relevance to OpStack**
- These are closer to the “govern the award” need, but they skew toward **finance/compliance** and the **grant operations** function.
- Innovate UK’s exploitation planning is more “commercialisation & market capture”, which is not the dominant frame of these tools (inference based on how they position; validate via demos if needed).

---

### Category D — Benefits Realisation / Strategic Portfolio / OKR tooling
This category is adjacent: it tracks strategy → initiatives → outcomes/value with governance.

Examples:
- **Wovex** positions as benefits realisation management software for tracking/optimising outcomes.  
  https://wovex.com/
- **Planview** (PPM) positions around portfolio governance and delivery management.  
  https://www.planview.com/products-solutions/solutions/project-portfolio-management/
- “AI-powered strategic portfolio management platforms” (list-style vendor overview) includes Planisware, ServiceNow, Planview, etc.  
  https://planisware.com/resources/strategic-planning-alignment/what-top-6-ai-strategic-portfolio-management-platforms

**Relevance to OpStack**
- This is the closest “commercial product family” to what you described: **make value capture visible and governed**.
- However, these tools are typically **enterprise PPM/strategy execution** platforms, not “Innovate UK exploitation plan in a box”.

---

### Category E — Consultancies and specialist tooling around post-award requirements
You’ll also see consultancies and “tools” focused on reporting, finance, and grant compliance support (often services-led rather than SaaS).

Example:
- PNO Innovation advertises IT tools for funding management (financial reporting dashboards, time tracking, etc.).  
  https://www.pnoinnovation.com/services/it-tools-for-funding-management/

**Relevance to OpStack**
- Suggests buyers often address this with **services + spreadsheets + reporting tools**, which is exactly where a focused “exploitation governance layer” could win.

---

## 3) So… do products already exist that do “Innovate UK exploitation governance”?
### What the evidence supports
- **Yes, there are many grant management products** (especially funder-side) and **post-award compliance products** (institution-side).  
  (See Categories A & C.)
- **Yes, there are benefits realisation / portfolio tools** that can track value/outcomes with governance.  
  (Category D.)

### What is *not* proven by the evidence here
- A dedicated, widely adopted product that is *specifically*:
  - “Innovate UK exploitation plan template + UK 5-year exploitation period + SOM capture tracking + evidence pack generation for progress reviews”
- That may exist, but it did not surface cleanly in public sources in this pass, and would need targeted vendor discovery and/or Innovate UK ecosystem scanning (monitoring service providers, IFS integrations, etc.).

**Inference (clearly labelled):**  
The market appears fragmented: grant admin tools + finance/compliance tooling + generic portfolio/benefits platforms. A “recipient-side exploitation execution system” tailored to Innovate UK governance could still be a differentiated niche if you can anchor it in the exact Innovate UK artefacts and review cadence.

---

## 4) What this means for an OpStack Innovate UK grant pitch (practical angles)
### Angle 1 — “OpStack = exploitation governance layer for SMEs”
Ground it in Innovate UK’s own process: exploitation plan is created from template and reviewed at each progress review meeting.  
Source: https://www.ukri.org/councils/innovate-uk/guidance-for-applicants/general-guidance/what-happens-if-you-receive-a-funding-offer/

OpStack pitch move:
- Turn the exploitation plan into a **living operating system**:
  - Objectives (exploitation outcomes)
  - Initiatives (commercial workstreams)
  - Evidence (customer traction, pilots, contracts, KPIs)
  - Financial trace (spend → progress → capture)

### Angle 2 — “Evidence pack automation”
Innovate UK expects ongoing reviews; OpStack could generate:
- progress review packs
- SOM tracking vs forecast
- customer pipeline evidence
- delivery + adoption telemetry
- risks & mitigations

### Angle 3 — “Complement, don’t compete with reporting portals”
UKRI has established outcomes reporting systems (e.g., Researchfish for research councils).  
Sources:  
https://www.ukri.org/manage-your-award/reporting-your-projects-outcomes/  
https://www.ukri.org/news/update-on-research-outcomes-collection-service/

OpStack should position as:
- upstream execution & evidence capture
- export structured outputs into whatever portal/process Innovate UK requires

---

## 5) Concrete product gaps OpStack could target (hypotheses to validate)
*(These are hypotheses, not asserted facts.)*
1. **Recipient-side exploitation workflow**: templates + cadence + ownership + evidence trails tied to Innovate UK artefacts.
2. **SOM instrumentation**: define SOM segments, attach measurable traction signals, and track capture over time (vs business case rhetoric).
3. **Audit-ready narrative**: link spend → work → outcomes → UK benefit.
4. **“Monitoring meeting ready”**: one-click pack generation aligned to what monitoring officers ask for.

---

## 6) Next research steps (if you want to go deeper)
If you want a second pass that’s more definitive on “is there already a product exactly like OpStack-for-Innovate-UK”, the best method is:
- Identify Innovate UK **Monitoring Service Providers (MSPs)** and see what tooling they mandate/use (often not obvious publicly).
- Scan Innovate UK ecosystem partners and templates in **Innovation Funding Service (IFS)** guidance docs.
- Do a vendor deep-dive on:
  - “benefits realisation management software UK government”
  - “innovation portfolio management software”
  - “grant recipient compliance tool exploitation plan”

(Those require additional targeted web research and likely vendor demo material.)
