# OpsStack Website - UI Restyle Plan

**Objective:** Transform the website from generic AI-generated template aesthetics to a distinctive, professional, human-centered design.

**Status:** In Progress

---

## Current Problems (Summary)

| Issue | Frequency | Impact |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Floating gradient orbs | 15+ across site | Screams "AI generated" |
| Glass cards everywhere | Every section | No visual variety |
| Gradient text on every heading | All h2s | Overdone, loses impact |
| Badge/pill section labels | All 8 sections | Repetitive pattern |
| Icon-in-box + text combos | 20+ instances | Generic, template-y |
| Staggered grid animations | Every card grid | Tutorial/course pattern |
| Same dual CTA buttons | 3+ locations | Repetitive |
| Mesh gradient backgrounds | Multiple sections | Shallow complexity |

## Section-by-Section Restyle Plan

### 1. HERO SECTION

**Reference:** Anythink (anythink.com)

**What makes the reference good:**
- Real photography as background (desk scene with objects, plants, keyboard)
- Dark overlay on photo for text contrast - keeps human/authentic feel
- Asymmetric two-column layout (text left, media right)
- Simple typography hierarchy - no gradient text effects
- Accent color used sparingly (orange for key phrase + primary button)
- Minimal buttons - solid colors, no glows or complex effects
- Interactive element adds engagement (AI chat input)
- Simple social proof line with checkmark
- No floating orbs, no glass cards, no badges

**Current OpsStack Hero Problems:**
- Floating animated orbs as background
- Gradient mesh background effect
- Gradient text on "clarity"
- Glass card effect on value props
- Centered layout with no visual anchor
- Glow effects on buttons
- No real imagery or human element

**Restyle Direction:**
1. **Background:** Replace orbs/mesh with real photography or illustration
   - Option A: High-quality desk/workspace photo with dark overlay
   - Option B: Custom illustration showing business operations
   - Option C: Abstract but purposeful shapes (not random orbs)

2. **Layout:** Asymmetric two-column
   - Left: Headline, subtext, CTAs
   - Right: Video embed, product screenshot, or interactive demo

3. **Typography:**
   - Remove gradient text effect
   - Use accent color (amber/gold or new accent) for emphasis phrase
   - Simpler, bolder hierarchy

4. **CTAs:**
   - Remove glow effects
   - Solid primary button (accent color)
   - Simple outline or dark secondary button
   - Add simple trust line below ("No commitment • Discovery call")

5. **Remove:**
   - All floating orbs
   - Mesh gradient background
   - Glass card effects
   - Animated glow effects

### 2. PROBLEM SECTION

**Reference:** (awaiting example)

**Current Problems:**
- 4 glass cards in grid
- Floating orbs background
- Badge label at top
- Gradient text highlight
- Icon-in-box pattern repeated

**Restyle Direction:**
- TBD based on reference

---

### 3. SOLUTION SECTION

**Reference:** (awaiting example)

**Current Problems:**
- Two-column glass cards
- Lists with check icons
- Badge label pattern
- Gradient text

**Restyle Direction:**
- TBD based on reference

---

### 4. PROCESS SECTION

**Reference:** Anythink "How it works" section

**What makes the reference good:**
- Completely flat design - NO card borders, NO backgrounds
- Simple numbered circles (accent color) above each step
- Bold title + description text only
- Three equal columns, clean grid
- Tagline at bottom as simple text
- Single CTA button below
- Pure dark background - no gradients, no effects

**Current OpsStack Process Problems:**
- Glass cards with borders and backgrounds
- Connector lines between steps (overdesigned)
- Gradient number badges
- Floating orbs in background
- Too much visual complexity for simple content

**Restyle Direction:**
1. **Remove all card styling** - no borders, no backgrounds, no glass effect
2. **Simple numbered indicators** - accent-colored circles with numbers, nothing fancy
3. **Flat layout** - title + description per column, clean grid
4. **Remove connector lines** - unnecessary visual noise
5. **Single CTA** at bottom if needed
6. **No background effects** - pure flat dark background

---

### 5. WHAT WE BUILD / FEATURES SECTION

**Reference:** Anythink "From Simple Ideas to Complex Systems" section

**What makes the reference good:**
- Cards have very subtle borders (dark gray on dark background)
- Each card features a REAL screenshot/graphic on the right side
- Graphics fade/blend into the card - not hard-edged boxes
- Text left-aligned within cards
- Simple "Learn more >" text links (accent color) - not buttons
- No icons-in-boxes pattern
- Cards feel integrated into the page, not floating
- Visual interest comes from real product imagery, not decorative effects

**Current OpsStack Problems:**
- Glass cards with prominent borders
- Icon-in-box pattern for each item
- No real imagery or screenshots
- Bullet point lists feel generic
- Cards float above background

**Restyle Direction:**
1. **Subtle card borders** - barely visible, same tone as background
2. **Add real imagery** - screenshots, diagrams, or illustrations per card
3. **Images should fade/blend** - gradient overlay so they're not hard boxes
4. **Remove icon-in-box pattern** - let the imagery do the work
5. **Simple text links** - "Learn more >" in accent color, not buttons
6. **Cards blend into page** - reduce contrast between card and background

---

### 6. WHY THIS WORKS SECTION

**Reference:** (awaiting example)

**Current Problems:**
- 5 cards (3+2 layout)
- One highlighted with accent
- Glass cards throughout
- Same hover effects

**Restyle Direction:**
- TBD based on reference

---

### 7. WHO THIS IS FOR SECTION

**Reference:** (awaiting example)

**Current Problems:**
- 2-column grid of 6 items
- Icon boxes
- Glass styling

**Restyle Direction:**
- TBD based on reference

---

### 8. CTA SECTION

**Reference:** (awaiting example)

**Current Problems:**
- Large glass card
- Checklist items
- Dual CTAs (same as hero)
- Floating orbs

**Restyle Direction:**
- TBD based on reference

## Global Style Changes

### Card Treatment Guidelines (from references)

**Three approaches - use appropriately:**

| Style | When to Use | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Flat (no cards)** | Simple sequential content, process steps | Process section |
| **Subtle cards** | Feature grids with imagery | What We Build |
| **Clean minimal cards** | Pricing, comparison tables | Pricing page |

**Universal card rules:**
- No glass morphism / backdrop blur
- No glow shadows
- No gradient borders
- Borders should be barely visible (if present)
- Cards blend INTO page, not float ABOVE it
- Real imagery > decorative icons
- Text links > buttons within cards

### Colors
- **New accent color consideration:** Orange (like reference) or keep amber/gold
- Reduce purple glow usage
- More contrast, less "everything glows"

### Typography
- Remove `.gradient-text` overuse
- Use color accents instead of gradients for emphasis
- Cleaner hierarchy

### Effects
- Remove or drastically reduce:
  - Floating orbs
  - Mesh gradients
  - Glass morphism (use sparingly if at all)
  - Glow shadows
  - Staggered animations

### Imagery
- Add real photography or custom illustrations
- Product screenshots or demos
- Human elements where appropriate

## Implementation Priority

1. Hero Section (highest impact, first impression)
2. CTA Section (conversion focus)
3. Problem/Solution Sections (core messaging)
4. Process Section (differentiation)
5. Supporting sections
