### Why This Works Section

**Headline:** Why this works

**Subheadline:** Most SMEs run on spreadsheets, inboxes and heroics. You've built something real - but your systems aren't empowering you.

**Reason Cards:**

1. **Days, Not Months**
   We build in days, not months. No gold-plating. No six-month projects. No waiting.

2. **Senior Delivery Only**
   You work directly with experienced product, tech and ops leaders. No juniors learning on your time.

3. **Value First, Always**
   See outcomes before you commit. If we can't prove value fast, you walk away.

4. **One System, Not Ten Subscriptions**
   Replace the patchwork of tools you're paying for but barely using.

5. **Clarity Before Complexity**
   We cut through noise and find what's really blocking you. Fast.

6. **Capability That Lasts**
   You get permanent improvement. Real tools. Real value. Not documentation.

## ABOUT PAGE

### Why This Exists - Founder Story Section

**Headline:** Why this exists - founder story

**Body Copy:**
I've spent 30 years building software, helping other teams build software, fixing operations and delivering real value. I've watched countless large organisations throw millions at "Digital Transformation" - polished slide decks that only work in the boardroom, frameworks that only ever worked in one context at a certain time, four-figure day rates paid to people with certificates not experience, agencies delivering bells and whistles on beautiful products that don't address the fundamental issues.

Meanwhile, SMEs turn over the amount big orgs waste on transformation - and do it on spreadsheets, inboxes and heroics.

I'm constantly amazed when I talk to SME friends and colleagues about how operations run on shared spreadsheets, WhatsApp messages, bloated sharepoint sites where you can't find what you need, great memory. Not because they lack ambition for digital tooling. Because they lack access.

No CTO. No delivery team. No one who can diagnose the real problem and actually deliver a fix. No partner who tells them the truth. No access to the kind of capability that bigger firms take for granted. Google results showing enterprise solutions at enterprise prices - not affordable, not practical.

**Highlight:** That gap is why this company exists.

**Statement:** No bullshit. No disappointment. No fees for something you'll never use.

**Tagline:** If you can describe your business, we can build something that improves your operational efficiency and your bottom line.

**Signature:** OpStack Founder - Jason Jones

### How We Work Section

**Headline:** How we work

**Principles:**

1. **Clarity before complexity**

   No bloat. No scope creep. Just the tool that moves the needle.

   We use AI to move fast and keep costs down. But every system is shaped by experienced humans who understand your business - not just the technology.

5. **Leave clients with capability that lasts**

3. **Credits, not retainers**
   You buy capability when you need it. No monthly drain. No unused hours. No guilt.

4. **Built around your way of working**
   We don't impose frameworks, methodologies or generic best practice. We amplify what already works. We fix what doesn't.

5. **Confidential and secure**
   NDAs signed before we start. Your data stays private. Your IP stays yours. Trust comes first.

6. **Momentum as a Service**
   Every time you engage us, something real gets built or fixed. No theatre. No alignment sessions. No drag. Just forward motion.
