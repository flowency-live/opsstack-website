## Brand Voice & Tone

### Voice Principles

1. **Direct & Confident**
   - Say what you mean without fluff
   - No hype, no superlatives, no theatre
   - Authoritative but not arrogant

2. **Low-Pressure**
   - Never pushy or aggressive
   - No exclamation marks (except "Design it NOW" CTA)
   - Let the work speak for itself

3. **Professional Clarity**
   - Terse, tight copy
   - No jargon unless necessary
   - Assume intelligence, explain clearly

4. **Action-Oriented**
   - Verbs over adjectives
   - Concrete over abstract
   - What we do, not what we think

### Writing Rules

**DO:**
- Use regular hyphens: multi-million, high-performing, over-engineer
- Write in full: "We will" not "We'll", "do not" not "don't"
- Keep it tight: Cut 25% after first draft
- Lead with insight: Problem first, solution second
- Be specific: "MVPs in a week" not "fast delivery"

**DO NOT:**
- Use em dashes - EVER
- Use exclamation marks (except "Design it NOW")
- Use superlatives: "best", "greatest", "amazing"
- Use buzzwords: "synergy", "paradigm", "leverage" (as verb)
- Write verbose explanations: Get to the point
